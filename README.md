About this Project: 

This project can be used by schools to automate all the manual attendance work and save lot's of time. A QR Code can be put on each ID Card and a mobile phone will scan it.
The mobile phone sends the data to a laptop which stores the data in an excel sheet, this data can be sent to any server. If you have any queries or want any specific improvements,
you can contact me through twitter or gmail.
